# Hemera

![preview](assets/__ALL__.png)

E3D Hemera is another example of the front heavy EVAs. The motor is huge and the whole extruder takes a lot of space so make sure to understand that the full print volume may not be accessible when using this EVA variant.

??? question "Why not bellow the rail?"

    I tried that on Aero - more informatino there.

Hemera's motor needs to be put on quite early in the assembly process, remember to grab the right belt before putting it on.
